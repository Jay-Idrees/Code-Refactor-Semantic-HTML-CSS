# Title

 The Power of semantic HTML tags in adding 'Class' to Websites


# About
 I designed this website during the first week of my coding boot camp experience at Columbia University, NY, USA. Date of publication: 9/25/2020. 
 
 This website is about an imaginary company Horiseon, which conducts SEO (Search Engine Optimization) operations. SEO is a process of improving the quality and quantity of user traffic to a website from search engines.

# Technologies used in the creation of this website

 HTML
 CSS
 Human Imagination and Creative Thinking
 
# Note to user

 - Note that there are two sets of codes in the index.html and style.css. The final code is at the top. The sub-optimal code is at the bottom in each of the files, shown as green comment. You can press Ctrl+/ to undo or redo comment.

 - Both codes in each of html and css files will produce about the same appearence of website, but notice how the final code (top) utilizes semantic tags, has less redundancy and is very easy to read. It has appropriate comments for each section and is more efficient (achieves more with fewer lines of code).

 - This code is free and you are welcome to re-process it in any way, shape or form, as needed to achieve your goal. 

 - For potential fellow boot campers/code seekers- enjoy the code for ideas, it is my pleasure if my work is able to offer any benifit in transforming your experience.


# Acquired Skills: 

With this project I was able to acquire the forllowing skills during the first week of my coding boot camp experience at Columbia University.  

* Command over building websites using semantic HTML and CSS.

* Implementing best practices in structuring code in HTML using nested elements.

* Implementing CSS styling via Class and elemental selectors.

* Linking external files to HTML.

* Implementing the box model in HTML for each element (nested or otherwise).

* Masterning Manipulation of cascading style architechure in CSS for website asthetics.

* Implementing version control by using Git workflow to initialize projects, track changes and host via remote server

* Deploying live pages in Git Hub with firm command over utilizing Master/Branch repository systems.

* Using command line/Linux interface for navigation, deployment, inspection and making revisions to files and directories. 

* Most importantly, this website building experience taught the significance of planning the design of a website to guide code structure prior to writing code. If this is not done right, code is written on the go w/o reasonable planning of design initially, it will look similar to the the sub-optimal code example. Which is haphazard, extraneous, "fragile" and difficult to debug and revise.
