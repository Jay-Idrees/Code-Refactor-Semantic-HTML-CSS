# Title

 The Power of semantic tags in HTML to add some 'Class' to Websites


# About
 I designed this website during the first week of my coding boot Camp experience at Columbia University, NY, USA on 9/25/2020. 
 
 This website is abut an imaginary company named Horiseon, which conducts SEO (Search Engine Optimization) operations. SEO is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.

 HTML
 CSS
 Human Imagination and Creative Thinking
 
# Note to user

 - Note that there are two sets of codes in the index.html and style.css. The final code is at the top. The suoptimal code is at the bottom in each file shown as green comment.

 - Both codes will produce theabout the same website, but notice how the fine code utilizes the semantic tags and is more efficiently writter, has less redundancy and very easy to read with appropriate comments. 

 - This code is free and you are welcome to re-process it in any way, shape or form, as needed to achieve your goal. 

 - For potential fellow boot campers/code seekers- enjoy the code for ideas, it is my pleasure if my work is able to offer any benifit in transforming your experience.
